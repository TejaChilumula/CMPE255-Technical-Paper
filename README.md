# 📊 Fraud Detection in Bitcoin Blockchain Network using Machine Learning

Blockchain provides a unique and accountable channel for financial forensics by mining its open and immutable transaction data. This paper presents a holistic applied data science approach to fraud detection in the Bitcoin network, utilizing the Elliptic++ dataset, which extends the Elliptic transaction dataset to include over 822𝑘 Bitcoin wallet addresses (nodes), each with 56 features, and 1.27𝑀 temporal interactions.

## 🎯 Key Contributions:
1. **Elliptic++ Dataset:** Extends the Elliptic transaction dataset and incorporates crucial graph data for comprehensive analysis.
2. **Graph Data Utilization:** Leverages four types of graph data for detection: 
   - Transaction-to-transaction graph
   - Address-to-address interaction graph
   - Address-transaction graph
   - User entity graph

## 🛠 Methodology:
- Utilizes diverse machine learning algorithms for fraud detection tasks on all four graphs.
- Shows the efficacy of enhanced features from the address-to-address and address-transaction graphs in detecting illicit transactions and addresses.
- Facilitates understanding of the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency transactions and strategies for fraud detection and prevention.

## 📂 Dataset Access:
The Elliptic++ dataset is made publicly available at [GitHub - EllipticPlusPlus](https://www.github.com/git-disl/EllipticPlusPlus).

This paper signifies the importance of leveraging blockchain data and machine learning techniques for fraud detection and prevention in cryptocurrency networks, highlighting the significance of transparent and accountable financial systems.
